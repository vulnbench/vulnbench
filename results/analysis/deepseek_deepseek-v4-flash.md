# deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash — VulnBench performance analysis

*Runs: 3 · Judges: openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4.8 · hint mode: description · source context: True · max_tokens: 4096*

## Why this model performed the way it did

deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash passed 18/200 instances (9.0%, 95% CI 5.8%–13.8%) with a mean judge score of 0.224.

Across 3 independent runs the pass rate was 10.0%, 6.5%, 9.0% (mean 8.5% ± 1.8%); 19.0% of instances passed in at least one run and 1.0% passed in every run — the gap between those two numbers is the model's run-to-run variance.

Of the 182 failed instances in the reference run: 109 (60%) because the patch modifies files unrelated to the ground-truth fix; 33 (18%) because the patch was judged irrelevant to the vulnerability; 18 (10%) because the judge scored the patch just below the pass threshold.

In total, 2 failures (1%) were harness or provider artifacts (API errors, empty responses, exhausted budgets) rather than judged model mistakes. Under the v2 quality gate, rows above 2% artifacts are not publishable.

Judge reasoning on failures clusters on 'wrong-location' (54 instances): it most often patched a plausible but wrong file or code path — a localization failure, expected to improve with better file hints or source context.

Relative strengths: cve year 2020: 33% vs suite median 0% (n=6); primary cwe CWE-94: 22% vs suite median 11% (n=18).

Relative weaknesses: ecosystem maven: 0% vs suite median 20% (n=5).

Cost: $0.07 total generation spend, $0.00 per passing patch, median generation time 19s.

## Failure modes

| Mode | Count | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| wrong_file | 109 | the patch modifies files unrelated to the ground-truth fix |
| off_target | 33 | the patch was judged irrelevant to the vulnerability |
| near_miss | 18 | the judge scored the patch just below the pass threshold |
| insufficient_fix | 16 | the model understood the issue but the fix was judged inadequate |
| likely_truncated | 3 | the diff appears cut off by the completion token limit |
| budget_exhausted | 2 | the model spent the entire completion budget (likely on hidden reasoning) and returned no visible text — a harness/config artifact, not a capability signal |
| not_a_diff | 1 | the model responded with prose or code instead of a unified diff |
