# x-ai/grok-4.1-fast — VulnBench performance analysis

*Runs: 3 · Judges: openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4-6 · hint mode: description · source context: True · max_tokens: 4096*

## Why this model performed the way it did

x-ai/grok-4.1-fast passed 7/200 instances (3.5%, 95% CI 1.7%–7.0%) with a mean judge score of 0.246.

Across 3 independent runs the pass rate was 2.5%, 5.5%, 3.5% (mean 3.8% ± 1.5%); 9.0% of instances passed in at least one run and 0.5% passed in every run — the gap between those two numbers is the model's run-to-run variance.

Of the 193 failed instances in the reference run: 144 (75%) because the diff appears cut off by the completion token limit; 34 (18%) because the patch modifies files unrelated to the ground-truth fix; 7 (4%) because the model understood the issue but the fix was judged inadequate.

In total, 2 failures (1%) were harness or provider artifacts (API errors, empty responses, exhausted budgets) rather than judged model mistakes. Under the v2 quality gate, rows above 2% artifacts are not publishable.

Judge reasoning on failures clusters on 'wrong-location' (108 instances): it most often patched a plausible but wrong file or code path — a localization failure, expected to improve with better file hints or source context.

Cost: $0.74 total generation spend, $0.11 per passing patch, median generation time 50s.

## Failure modes

| Mode | Count | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| likely_truncated | 144 | the diff appears cut off by the completion token limit |
| wrong_file | 34 | the patch modifies files unrelated to the ground-truth fix |
| insufficient_fix | 7 | the model understood the issue but the fix was judged inadequate |
| near_miss | 4 | the judge scored the patch just below the pass threshold |
| off_target | 2 | the patch was judged irrelevant to the vulnerability |
| budget_exhausted | 1 | the model spent the entire completion budget (likely on hidden reasoning) and returned no visible text — a harness/config artifact, not a capability signal |
| empty_patch | 1 | the provider returned no patch text without exhausting the token budget |
