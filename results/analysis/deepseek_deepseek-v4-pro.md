# deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro — VulnBench performance analysis

*Runs: 3 · Judges: openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4.8 · hint mode: description · source context: True · max_tokens: 4096*

## Why this model performed the way it did

deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro passed 20/200 instances (10.0%, 95% CI 6.6%–14.9%) with a mean judge score of 0.219.

Across 3 independent runs the pass rate was 11.5%, 11.5%, 10.0% (mean 11.0% ± 0.9%); 22.0% of instances passed in at least one run and 3.0% passed in every run — the gap between those two numbers is the model's run-to-run variance.

Of the 180 failed instances in the reference run: 81 (45%) because the patch modifies files unrelated to the ground-truth fix; 39 (22%) because the model spent the entire completion budget (likely on hidden reasoning) and returned no visible text — a harness/config artifact, not a capability signal; 17 (9%) because the model understood the issue but the fix was judged inadequate.

⚠ On 39 instances (20% of the benchmark) the model exhausted the completion token budget without emitting any visible text — almost always hidden reasoning consuming the shared budget. These score 0 but say more about the token limit than about the model's patching ability; the pass rate is a lower bound until the run is repeated with an adequate budget.

In total, 39 failures (20%) were harness or provider artifacts (API errors, empty responses, exhausted budgets) rather than judged model mistakes. Under the v2 quality gate, rows above 2% artifacts are not publishable.

The model produced a parseable diff on only 80% of instances (answer rate); capability comparisons against models with higher answer rates are confounded until this is resolved.

Judge reasoning on failures clusters on 'root-cause-missed' (42 instances): its patches most often treated symptoms rather than the underlying root cause.

Relative strengths: primary cwe CWE-1321: 40% vs suite median 20% (n=5); cve year 2021: 40% vs suite median 20% (n=5); cve year 2018: 14% vs suite median 0% (n=7).

Relative weaknesses: cve year 2019: 0% vs suite median 14% (n=7).

Cost: $1.64 total generation spend, $0.08 per passing patch, median generation time 53s.

## Failure modes

| Mode | Count | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| wrong_file | 81 | the patch modifies files unrelated to the ground-truth fix |
| budget_exhausted | 39 | the model spent the entire completion budget (likely on hidden reasoning) and returned no visible text — a harness/config artifact, not a capability signal |
| insufficient_fix | 17 | the model understood the issue but the fix was judged inadequate |
| likely_truncated | 15 | the diff appears cut off by the completion token limit |
| off_target | 14 | the patch was judged irrelevant to the vulnerability |
| near_miss | 13 | the judge scored the patch just below the pass threshold |
| not_a_diff | 1 | the model responded with prose or code instead of a unified diff |
