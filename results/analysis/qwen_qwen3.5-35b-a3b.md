# qwen/qwen3.5-35b-a3b — VulnBench performance analysis

*Runs: 3 · Judges: openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4-6 · hint mode: description · source context: True · max_tokens: 4096*

## Why this model performed the way it did

qwen/qwen3.5-35b-a3b passed 3/200 instances (1.5%, 95% CI 0.5%–4.3%) with a mean judge score of 0.192.

Across 3 independent runs the pass rate was 0.0%, 0.0%, 1.5% (mean 0.5% ± 0.9%); 1.5% of instances passed in at least one run and 0.0% passed in every run — the gap between those two numbers is the model's run-to-run variance.

Of the 197 failed instances in the reference run: 116 (59%) because the patch modifies files unrelated to the ground-truth fix; 24 (12%) because the diff appears cut off by the completion token limit; 16 (8%) because the patch was judged irrelevant to the vulnerability.

In total, 6 failures (3%) were harness or provider artifacts (API errors, empty responses, exhausted budgets) rather than judged model mistakes. Under the v2 quality gate, rows above 2% artifacts are not publishable.

Judge reasoning on failures clusters on 'wrong-location' (110 instances): it most often patched a plausible but wrong file or code path — a localization failure, expected to improve with better file hints or source context.

Cost: $0.86 total generation spend, $0.29 per passing patch, median generation time 11s.

## Failure modes

| Mode | Count | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| wrong_file | 116 | the patch modifies files unrelated to the ground-truth fix |
| likely_truncated | 24 | the diff appears cut off by the completion token limit |
| off_target | 16 | the patch was judged irrelevant to the vulnerability |
| near_miss | 15 | the judge scored the patch just below the pass threshold |
| insufficient_fix | 15 | the model understood the issue but the fix was judged inadequate |
| budget_exhausted | 6 | the model spent the entire completion budget (likely on hidden reasoning) and returned no visible text — a harness/config artifact, not a capability signal |
| not_a_diff | 5 | the model responded with prose or code instead of a unified diff |
