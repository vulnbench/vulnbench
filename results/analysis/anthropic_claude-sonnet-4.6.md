# anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6 — VulnBench performance analysis

*Runs: 3 · Judges: openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4-6 · hint mode: description · source context: True · max_tokens: 4096*

## Why this model performed the way it did

anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6 passed 14/200 instances (7.0%, 95% CI 4.2%–11.4%) with a mean judge score of 0.315.

Across 3 independent runs the pass rate was 9.0%, 10.5%, 7.0% (mean 8.8% ± 1.8%); 14.5% of instances passed in at least one run and 5.0% passed in every run — the gap between those two numbers is the model's run-to-run variance.

Of the 186 failed instances in the reference run: 91 (49%) because the patch modifies files unrelated to the ground-truth fix; 35 (19%) because the judge scored the patch just below the pass threshold; 26 (14%) because the model understood the issue but the fix was judged inadequate.

Judge reasoning on failures clusters on 'incomplete-scope' (58 instances): its patches most often fixed part of the issue but missed other affected paths the gold fix covered.

Relative strengths: severity critical: 14% vs suite median 0% (n=21).

Cost: $3.99 total generation spend, $0.28 per passing patch, median generation time 15s.

## Failure modes

| Mode | Count | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| wrong_file | 91 | the patch modifies files unrelated to the ground-truth fix |
| near_miss | 35 | the judge scored the patch just below the pass threshold |
| insufficient_fix | 26 | the model understood the issue but the fix was judged inadequate |
| off_target | 22 | the patch was judged irrelevant to the vulnerability |
| not_a_diff | 7 | the model responded with prose or code instead of a unified diff |
| likely_truncated | 5 | the diff appears cut off by the completion token limit |
