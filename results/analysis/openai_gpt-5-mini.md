# openai/gpt-5-mini — VulnBench performance analysis

*Runs: 3 · Judges: openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4-6 · hint mode: description · source context: True · max_tokens: 4096*

## Why this model performed the way it did

openai/gpt-5-mini passed 9/200 instances (4.5%, 95% CI 2.4%–8.3%) with a mean judge score of 0.279.

Across 3 independent runs the pass rate was 4.5%, 5.0%, 4.5% (mean 4.7% ± 0.3%); 8.0% of instances passed in at least one run and 2.5% passed in every run — the gap between those two numbers is the model's run-to-run variance.

Of the 191 failed instances in the reference run: 189 (99%) because the model responded with prose or code instead of a unified diff; 1 (1%) because the model understood the issue but the fix was judged inadequate; 1 (1%) because the provider returned no patch text without exhausting the token budget.

In total, 1 failures (0%) were harness or provider artifacts (API errors, empty responses, exhausted budgets) rather than judged model mistakes. Under the v2 quality gate, rows above 2% artifacts are not publishable.

The model produced a parseable diff on only 0% of instances (answer rate); capability comparisons against models with higher answer rates are confounded until this is resolved.

Judge reasoning on failures clusters on 'wrong-location' (106 instances): it most often patched a plausible but wrong file or code path — a localization failure, expected to improve with better file hints or source context.

Relative strengths: cve year 2021: 20% vs suite median 0% (n=5).

Cost: $0.61 total generation spend, $0.07 per passing patch, median generation time 17s.
